# Attestations for this Project

Each article is paired with an independent attestation, preserved as a PDF. These attestations are produced via a structured knowledge engine (e.g., OpenAI’s ChatGPT) and cover:
- Fact checking of primary content
- Legal defensibility analysis
- Citation validation

Each attestation PDF is stored in `/attestations` and referenced from its parent article.
