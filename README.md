## Abstract

This whitepaper examines how AI systems can assist in the creation of new knowledge rather than merely replicating existing information. It proposes an epistemic framework in which machine learning models participate in structured knowledge generation, guided by human-defined objectives and validation processes. The discussion outlines implications for reasoning, authorship, and cognitive accountability in hybrid human–AI systems.
